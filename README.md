### About this project

* Walk the user through how climate change is perceived today, 
* Share specific data on carbon dioxide, warming trends, and how it can impact them where they live.

### Target Audience
Our users are those who
* live in the United States
* and are neutral or passive in how climate change impacts them and their community.
